Hello and thank you for downloading desktop music box! Here's some fun stuff you can do that is not intuitive to figure out:

Features:

- Drag and drop an audio file into the music box window, and it will play it on loop!

Keybinds:

- LCTRL + T toggles the remaining time display

- LCTRL + W toggles the window always being on top

- LCTRL + X toggles the window transparency

- LCTRL + R makes the aspect ratio of the window normal again.
        The width stays the same; the height is changed to match the native aspect ratio.

Cheats:

- LCTRL + U expands the difficulty upper bound to 100 (why would you do this to yourself)
    - Holding SHIFT while changing the difficulty changes it by 5 instead of 1
    - You can also use the scroll wheel to change difficulty instead

- LCTRL + A toggles auto-wind (ugh. cheater!!!)

- LCTRL + 1/2/3 changes the windup speed. 1 is normal, 2 is 2.0x, and 3 is 3.0x

more to come maybe !!
